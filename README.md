# Airbnb Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Airbnb listings, aimed at uncovering insights related to pricing, availability, and key listing features. The project leverages popular Python libraries to handle, analyze, and visualize the data effectively.

## Project Overview

The primary objectives of this EDA are to:

* Understand the structure and key attributes of the Airbnb dataset
* Identify patterns and trends in listing prices, availability, and locations
* Handle missing data and assess data quality
* Generate clear and informative visualizations to support findings

The analysis is conducted in a Jupyter Notebook environment, offering an interactive and structured walkthrough of the entire process.

## Libraries Used

A set of powerful and widely-used Python libraries have been employed for data manipulation, visualization, and quality assessment:

| Library        | Description                                                                                                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **NumPy**      | Fundamental package for numerical computing. It supports efficient array operations and mathematical functions.                 |
| **Pandas**     | A flexible data analysis library used for reading, cleaning, and manipulating structured data.                                  |
| **Matplotlib** | A core plotting library in Python that provides detailed control for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations. |
| **Seaborn**    | Built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn offers a high-level interface for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics. |
| **Missingno**  | A visualization tool designed specifically for identifying and summarizing missing data within a dataset.                       |
